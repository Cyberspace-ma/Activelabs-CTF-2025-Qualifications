## Cryptography

### Base
This is a base64. Try harder with it.

### WW2

"The first rotor might start with 'EKMF...' and ends with '...RCJ'." "the rotors are not in the correct order, fix them."
**Alan Turing**: Do not worry, I will do the impossible to decrypt it.

- the rotors are not in the correct order fix them
- please if you get the flag read it slowly :) or recored your reaction
### RSA

This is just RSA; what more can I say?

### Sweets
Well, hi again! Let's see how you will figure this out.

## DFIR

### Infrabroken

An unknown event occurred on my system. I discovered my data on the dark web, but I have no idea how it was leaked from my server. When I checked the outgoing data, I found nothing suspicious. I'm completely confused about this situation and need you to investigate the incident to determine the source of this anomaly !!!

### Moha9i9Konan

An attacker sends a phishing email disguised as a legitimate notification about a package arrival. The email instructs the recipient to click on a link to view an invoice and product details, which is actually a malicious attempt to steal sensitive information or install malware on the victim's machine !!!

### SMILAH

An employee at a mid-sized tech company has gone rogue. They're under pressure from a competitor or a foreign entity to steal sensitive company data‚Äîmaybe intellectual property, financial data, or customer lists !!!
