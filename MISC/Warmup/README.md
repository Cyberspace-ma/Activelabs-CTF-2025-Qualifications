# **Warmup Challenge â€“ PNG Header Fix**  

This challenge was meant to be an easy warmup, yet surprisingly, no one solved it!

### **Step 1: Analyzing the Image in HxD**  

To begin, we simply **drag and drop** the given image file into **HxD**, a hex editor.

Upon inspecting the hex data, we immediately notice something unusual:  

- The file **appears to be a PNG**  
- However, the **PNG header is missing**

### **Step 2: Restoring the PNG Header**  

A quick Google search reveals the correct **PNG file header structure**:

The standard PNG header is:  
```
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52
```
We simply **paste** this header at the beginning of the hex file.

### **Step 3: Viewing the Fixed Image**  

After adding the missing bytes, the image **now displays correctly**, revealing the flag inside it.

### **Final Flag**  

**`CSP{Th1s_M3M3_ST1LL_TH3_B35T}`**

### **Conclusion**  

This challenge was straightforward:  
1. **Drag the image into HxD**  
2. **Identify the missing PNG header**  
3. **Restore it** using a known PNG signature  
4. **Open the fixed image to reveal the flag**  

Sometimes, the simplest challenges are overlooked! ðŸš€
