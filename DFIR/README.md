An unknown event occurred on my system. I discovered my data on the dark web, but I have no idea how it was leaked from my server. When I checked the outgoing data, I found nothing suspicious. I'm completely confused about this situation and need you to investigate the incident to determine the source of this anomaly !!!

An attacker sends a phishing email disguised as a legitimate notification about a package arrival. The email instructs the recipient to click on a link to view an invoice and product details, which is actually a malicious attempt to steal sensitive information or install malware on the victim's machine !!!

An employee at a mid-sized tech company has gone rogue. They're under pressure from a competitor or a foreign entity to steal sensitive company dataâ€”maybe intellectual property, financial data, or customer lists !!!
